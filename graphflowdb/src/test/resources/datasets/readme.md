# Datasets

This file contains the description of all the datasets available for testing Graphflow. It is recommended that the datasets should be of a small size (maximum 2000 vertices and edges), since some of the tests run on the entire vertex and edge data.

### 1. railway
- 7 types of vertices and 7 different edge labels.
- ~700 vertices and ~1400 edges.
- 5 vertex properties of type: INT, BOOLEAN and STRING.
- base folder: `railway-data/`
- path to metadata file: `railway-data/metadata.json`
